**ConnectWit** is a private social network MVP designed for close-knit friend groups. It was inspired by Instagram but reimagined to prioritize tighter social circles and real-time interaction.

Built with React, Vite, Chakra UI, and Firebase, the project handles authentication, media sharing, and live updates — making it a strong foundation for scalable social platforms.

## Features

- **Authentication**: User authentication via Firebase (sign up, login, logout).
- **Image Uploads**: Users can upload images as posts.
- **Like & Comment System**: Users can like and comment on posts.
- **Profile Management**: Users can update their profiles and view posts from other users.
- **Real-Time Updates**: The app uses Firebase's real-time capabilities to update posts, likes, and comments instantly.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**:
  - **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - **Chakra UI**: A simple, modular, and accessible component library for React.
  - **Vite**: A fast, next-generation build tool for modern web development.
  - **Zustand**: A small, fast, and scalable state-management tool.

- **Backend**:
  - **Firebase**: A backend-as-a-service (BaaS) for real-time data storage, authentication, and more.
